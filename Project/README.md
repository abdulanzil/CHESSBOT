A Chess game with the power of Computer Vision and AI.

White is the Human player, Black is the AI opponent.

Camera placed on the top of the chessboard will capture the chessboard, Identifies the move made by player, and displays it.
Then It will make the move and show it on the display.

There is a timer of 15 minutes for both players each.

There is a buzzer to press after making each move on chessboard. It is controlled using Arduino microcontroller.


# CHESSBOARD SETUP
Human player pieces should be White in colour (pure white more preferred)
